# Hyperchat

Example chat applications powered by the hyperborea protocol.

This application is not intended for real use, and is not well written. Its sole purpose is to show how could you implement your own application using the protocol and its implementation library.

## Usage

After the first start app will generate default `params.json` file. You can look through it to change some values.

### Client

```bash
hyperchat client <server address>
```

### Server

```bash
hyperchat server
```
